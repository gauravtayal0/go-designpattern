### Singleton is one of the most common and simplest design patterns in terms of its class diagram. Infact diagram just holds a single class.

# Wikipedia defines Singleton Pattern as:

In software engineering, the singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one *single instance*. This is useful when exactly one object is needed to coordinate actions across the system. 

The term comes from the mathematical concept of a singleton.


### Implementation

> There are various ways to implement the singleton pattern in Go, but it is also quite easy to get it wrong. The right way to implement a singleton pattern in Go is to use the sync packageâ€™s Once.Do() function. This function makes sure that your specified code is executed only once and never more than once.

singleton package with Once.Do() 

```golang
package singleton

import (
    "sync"
)

type singleton struct {}

var instance *singleton
var once sync.Once

func GetInstance() *singleton {
    once.Do(func() {
        instance = &singleton{}
    })
    return instance
}
```
